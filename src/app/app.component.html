  <p>This page is to assist in scoring your Scrabble game.  Here are some useful instructions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>There is space for four players.  If your game has fewer than 4 players, ignore the spaces you do not need.</li>
    <li>Each player has a place to input words, words to be scored, and a checkbox.  If you use all 7 tiles in your turn, check the box.</li>
    <li>The your word box is for you to enter the word as you would like it to appear in the table of plays below.  You may use any character you wish for blank tiles.</li>
    <li>The word to score box is for you to input the words taking into account bonus tiles. For example, if you play the word "bat" and the "b" is on the double letter square, type "bbat." In this box, SKIP blank tiles.</li>
    <li>Along the same lines, if you play a tile on a double or triple word square, repeat the word that many times.  For example, if you play the word "bat" and any of the tiles land on a double word square, type "batbat."</li>
    <li>At times, you might end up playing tiles in such a way that you are forming multiple words.  For instance,  you might play a "b" before the word "at" to form "bat" then continue your play to form the word "brad."  In such instances, you can either play the words as different words ("bat" AND "brad") or all as 1 word ("batbrad").</li>
